JSON-GLib - A JSON parser for GLib-based libraries and applications
===================================================================

JSON-GLib implements a full JSON parser using GLib and GObject.

Use JSON-GLib it is possible to parse and generate valid JSON data
structures, using a DOM-like API. JSON-GLib also offers GObject
integration, providing the ability to serialize and deserialize
GObject instances to and from JSON data types.

JSON is the JavaScript Object Notation; it can be used to represent
objects and object hierarchies while retaining human-readability.

GLib is a C library providing common and efficient data types for
the C developers.

GObject is a library providing a run-time Object Oriented type system
for C developers. GLib and GObject are extensively used by the GTK+
toolkit and by the GNOME project.
